The **potato** is a [root vegetable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_vegetable "Root vegetable") native to the [Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas "Americas"), a [starchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starch "Starch") [tuber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuber "Tuber") of the [plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant "Plant") **_Solanum tuberosum_**, and the plant itself is a [perennial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_plant "Perennial plant") in the nightshade family, [Solanaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanaceae "Solanaceae").[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato#cite_note-2)

Wild potato [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species "Species"), originating in modern-day [Peru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru "Peru"), can be found throughout the Americas, from the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") to southern [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile "Chile").[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato#cite_note-3) The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated by [indigenous peoples of the Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas "Indigenous peoples of the Americas") independently in multiple locations,[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato#cite_note-UniWisconsin-4) but later genetic testing of the wide variety of [cultivars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultivar "Cultivar") and wild species traced a single origin for potatoes. In the area of present-day southern [Peru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru "Peru") and extreme northwestern [Bolivia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia "Bolivia"), from a species in the [_Solanum brevicaule_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanum_brevicaule "Solanum brevicaule") complex, potatoes were [domesticated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication "Domestication") approximately 7,000â€“10,000 years ago.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato#cite_note-Spooner_2005_14694%E2%80%9399-5)[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato#cite_note-LostCrops-6)[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato#cite_note-John_Michael_Francis_2005-7) In the [Andes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes "Andes") region of South America, where the species is [indigenous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_species "Indigenous species"), some close relatives of the potato are cultivated.

Potatoes were introduced to Europe from the Americas in the second half of the 16th century by the Spanish. Today they are a [staple food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staple_food "Staple food") in many parts of the world and an integral part of much of the world's [food supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_supply "Food supply"). As of 2014, potatoes were the world's fourth-largest food crop after [maize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize "Maize") (corn), [wheat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat "Wheat"), and [rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice "Rice").[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato#cite_note-potpro-8)

Following millennia of [selective breeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_breeding "Selective breeding"), there are now over 5,000 [different types of potatoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_potato_cultivars "List of potato cultivars").[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato#cite_note-LostCrops-6) Over 99% of presently cultivated potatoes worldwide descended from varieties that originated in the lowlands of [south-central Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zona_Sur "Zona Sur").[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato#cite_note-chile-9)[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato#cite_note-Ames2008-10)

The importance of the potato as a food source and culinary ingredient varies by region and is still changing. It remains an essential crop in Europe, especially Northern and Eastern Europe, where [per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_capita "Per capita") production is still the highest in the world, while the most rapid expansion in production over the past few decades has occurred in [southern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Asia "Southern Asia") and [eastern Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Asia "Eastern Asia"), with China and India leading the world in overall production as of 2018.
